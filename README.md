# Set Chat Filter Command

This plugin allows you to change your chat log filter settings via command instead of UI. 

Mostly developed for personal use but could find utility somewhere else!

## Use cases:

- Integration to macros or other UI plugins such as QOL Bar
- Text command fanatics

## Help:
- Use ChatTyper plugin to determine the type of a message
